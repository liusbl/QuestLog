--------
Gather 5 loads of Rethban Ore and bring it to Brother Paxton in the Northshire Library.

Rethban Ore is named after the man who first found it, Bart Rethban. When smelted it's not as strong as iron, but its ore has a dark, flat color that some scribes use in their dyes. It can be found in the Rethban Caverns, north of here.

We usually have some in stock, but we're too busy preparing for Orc attacks to gather any. And besides...Redridge Gnolls are now living in the Rethban Caverns and their Drudgers are gathering the ore themselves.

So if you need some, you'll have to get it yourself.
