Bring 8 Torn Murloc Fins to Guard Thomas at the east Elwynn bridge.

The Stormwind Army has placed a bounty on murloc lurkers and foragers in Elwynn. Slaughter them and bring me their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well.

The murlocs have built a village at Stone Cairn Lake north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks.
