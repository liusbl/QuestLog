Talk to Gryan Stoutmantle. He usually can be found in the stone tower on Sentinel Hill, just off the road, in the middle of Westfall.

Looks to me you've seen quite a bit of combat in your time, <class>. If you haven't already, you should report to Gryan Stoutmantle. He heads up the People's Militia, aimed at protecting the farmlands of Westfall. I bet he could use your help. You can usually find him in the stone tower on Sentinel Hill, just off the road in the middle of Westfall.
