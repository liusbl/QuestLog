Speak with Innkeeper Farley at the Lion's Pride Inn.
--------
Every adventurer should rest when exhaustion sets in - and there is no finer place to get rest and relaxation than at the Lion's Pride Inn!

My best friend, Innkeeper Farley, runs the Lion's Pride. If you tell him I sent you, he may give you the special discounted rates on food and drink.

To find the Lion's Pride Inn, travel south along the road from here -- you can't miss it!
