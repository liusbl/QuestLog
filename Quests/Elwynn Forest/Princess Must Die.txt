Kill Princess, grab her collar, then bring it back to Ma Stonefield at the Stonefield Farm.
--------
The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess. The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies!

So before she comes to our fields...Princess must die! Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time!

Princess is usually over at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch, to the east and beyond the Maclure farm. Get her before she gets hungry and comes back here!
