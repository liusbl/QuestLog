Bring 6 Red Linen Bandanas to Sara Timberlain at the Eastvale Logging Camp.
--------
The Defias gang in Northshire wears burlap masks, but the Defias in Elwynn wear linen which I can use to make fine linen goods.

Bring me red linen bandanas and I'll use them to fashion something for you.

Defias gang members have camps pocketed throughout Elwynn.
