Bring 8 Bundles of Wood to Raelen at the Eastvale Logging Camp.
--------
I've got a real problem on my hands. I have a deadline looming for an order of lumber, and I'm running out of time. The wolves and bears north of here have chased my workers away from the bundles of wood that they've already chopped.
Something more is needed as the text here just because I'm implementing scrolling so something is needed.
I've already talked to Deputy Rainer about clearing the animals, but I need someone to go collect the wood for me. If you could collect eight bundles of wood for me I might just make my deadline.
